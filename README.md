Gameplay
Basic Gameplay
Before each duel, each player draws a card in order to see who gets the first turn. Before each duel, both players must make sure to have a deck of no more and no less than 30 cards, which must contain at least one Digimon card.
This deck, henceforth called the "Online Deck", will be used to draw cards. Additionally, an "Offline Deck" will exist and will correspond to the space where used cards and defeated Digimon will go. Unless stated by a card effect, no card may leave the Offline Deck.
At the start of each duel, both players draw four cards, place a Digimon in play and send at most one card to the DP slot, which will grant them a fixed amount of DP, or Digivolve Points. After that, the first battle phase take place.
Other than the first turn, every turn follows the following order of events:

Draw Phase
The player in turn will draw cards from their Online Deck until they have exactly four cards in their hand. They may check the cards and pass to the next phase, or call for a mulligan, on which they will discard their whole hand in order to draw four new cards.
The player may do as many mulligans as they like as long as they have cards in their Online Deck. Discarded cards go to the Offline Deck.

Preparation Phase
If the player doesn't have a Digimon on the field, they may place one from their hand. While the player can theoretically place any Digimon in their hand, Champion level Digimon (Level IV in Japan) will get their HP and attack power cut in half if they are put into play directly, 
and Ultimate level Digimon (level V in Japan) will get their stats cut by three fourths. This penalty won't go away by evolving the Digimon naturally, but may go away if evolved through certain option cards such as Special Digivolve. If the opponent doesn't have a Digimon on the field by this phase, the rest of the turn is skipped.
If the Digimon played is a Partner Card, then the player may evolve them into their Armor form, given that they have already obtained their respective Digi-Egg. An Armor Digimon's power may be augmented by Digi-Parts and levelling up, but may not evolve naturally into any other Digimon.

Digivolve Phase
If the player has a Digimon card on his or her hand, they may place it on the DP slot. The player will then gain DP equivalent to the number of DP the card is stated to give. If the player has any Digimon their current Digimon may evolve to and has enough DP to do so, 
then the player may discard the entirety of their DP slot (thus making their available DP to 0) in order to evolve the card. A Digimon is eligible for evolving if it is of the same specialty of the card currently in play, and is of a level higher than the card currently in play.
In addition, if the player has any evolution card on their hand by this phase, 
they may play them. If the conditions dictated by the card are met, then the Digimon will be allowed to evolve as described in the card. Regardless of outcome, the card will then be sent to the Offline Deck.
Digimon levels are detailed as follows:
Rookie > Champion > Ultimate
For a Digimon in play to evolve to a Digimon in hand, it's of utmost importance that the level of the Digimon in play to be exactly one level below the Digimon to be evolved into. If this condition is not met, then the Digimon may not evolve. For example, a Rookie Digimon may evolve naturally into a Champion Digimon of its same color, 
but never into an Ultimate Digimon.

Attack Phase
On this phase, both player may choose one of their Digimon's attacks to inflict damage to the opponent's Digimon. There are exactly three attacks available to each Digimon. An attack may be selected by pushing Circle, Triangle or X (from now on, each attack will be associated with its respective button). 
The X attack normally has an added effect, which may aid the player in disrupting the opponent's strategy. For example, DemiDevimon's Butt Smasher attack, set to X, does triple damage to Digimon aligned with the Nature element,
while Garurumon's Ice Wall will cancel the opponent's attack and counterattack with the same strength only if the opponent's chosen attack was a circle button attack. 
The chosen attack will remain hidden from the other player until the end of the next phase.

Option Phase
Each player may place any face-up card on their option card slot for their effects to resolve, or place a face-down card from the top of their deck (this last process is known as "all-or-nothing"). If the chosen card has any effect, it will resolve; otherwise it will generate a Misfire Failure and do nothing.
If the chosen card has an effect, but the conditions for it to happen are not met, then a Misfire Failure condition will also be generated. Evolution cards may not be activated on this face. If the result of an all-or-nothing is an evolution card, then the card will generate a Misfire Failure by default.
It's important to note that the turn's player will place their option card first, giving their opponent a chance to retaliate.
Once the effects of the placed cards are resolved, the effects of any X attack will be resolved only if the Digimon's owner choose an X attack to inflict damage.

Battle Phase
The active Digimon will attack each other in this phase. The Digimon of the player in turn will attack first unless a card effect states otherwise. The opponent's Digimon will lose HP equal to the attack power (AP from now on) of the other Digimon's chosen attack.
If the latter Digimon's HP are not reduced to 0 beforehand, then the opponent's Digimon may attack the Digimon of the player in turn and inflict damage.

End Phase
This phase wraps up a player's turn. In this phase, any option card left on the option slot is sent to the Offline Deck along with any active Digimon whose HP were reduced to zero. After those action are done, the next player's turn may begin.
The game ends when a player defeats three of their opponent's Digimon, or when the opponent is unable to put another Digimon from their deck into play. Said player is declared the winner. If, for some reason, both players achieve a win condition at the same time, then the game is declared a draw.
Experience points may be awarded to the winner's partner cards, and the winner may receive a booster pack containing three cards upon winning.
